# InterSystems IRIS Full Stack QuickStart

In this QuickStart exercise, you will create the basic information management infrastructure for a small manufacturing company that roasts, packages, and sells delicious, freshly roasted coffee beans. Along the way, you’ll learn how the InterSystems IRIS® data platform can serve as the backbone of your IT architecture.

This exercise runs in an InterSystems sandbox environment and is divided into three parts, introducing the processes that you as a coffee manufacturer need to follow. Along the way, you will set up everything from inventorying raw coffee beans to selling them in an online portal. 

- **Part 1:** Write SQL to create and populate databases.
- **Part 2:** Build a RESTful API to handle business functions using ObjectScript.
- **Part 3:** Build an online storefront to sell your artisan coffee beans using the popular JavaScript framework, Vue.js.
